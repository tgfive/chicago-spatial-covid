# chicago-spatial-covid
We examine an application of the Law of Mass Action to model the outbreak of COVID-19 in Chicago.
	We begin with a zero-dimension (ODE) compartmental epidemiological model consisting of Susceptible, Infected, and Removed populations (SIR model).
	We then develop a spatially distributed version of the model in the form of reaction-diffusion equations (PDE).

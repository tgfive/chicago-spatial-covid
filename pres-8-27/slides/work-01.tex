	{\large Start by defining the zero-dimension model:}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Start with a population of \emph{susceptibles} ($S$)
		\item Some of the population may become \emph{infected} ($I$) upon emergence of the virus
		\item Infected individuals interact with susceptibles at rate $\beta$ to draw new members into $I$
		\item A fraction of $I$ recover or die at a rate $\gamma$ moving to the \emph{removed} ($R$) population
	\end{enumerate}

	This represents processes that occur in a ``well mixed'' situation.

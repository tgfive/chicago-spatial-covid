	{\large Transition to PDE model (proof of concept)}
	
	\vspace{.5cm}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The transition rate $\gamma$ is an ``individual'' parameter, so the value is preserved at the PDE level.
		\item The transmission rate $\beta$ depends on the interaction between individuals, so this must be modified.

		\item The geometry (shape and density distribution) of Chicago must be defined (Census data).
		\item Suitable initial infected distributions must be seeded.

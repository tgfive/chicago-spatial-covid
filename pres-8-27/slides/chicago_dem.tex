\begin{slide}{Demographics and Death Rates}
The City of Chicago Data Portal provides COVID data in demographic categories for age, race, and sex. \\
We begin by fitting $\alpha$ for each category independently, where
\begin{itemize}
	\item $\delta$, $\gamma$, and $\rho$ are constants determined medical literature, and
	\item $R_0$ is determined from the Rt Live model.
\end{itemize}

		The average death rate of Chicago is then calculated by a weighted mean:
		$$\alpha = \frac{1}{\sum N_i} \sum \alpha_i N_i$$

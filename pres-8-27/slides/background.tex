\begin{slide}{Background}
The study of infectious diseases began with Bernoulli in 1760. \\
The study of a critical level of transmissibility for a disease is fundamental in epidemiology. \\
This is useful for
\begin{itemize}
	\item predicting counterintuitive effects of treatments, and
	\item considering containment measures
\end{itemize}
\vfill
The main flavors of models fit under deterministic/stochastic and discrete/continuous. \\

Here we consider a deterministic and continuous compartment model (Kermack-McKendrick model). \\
